# Ventilation Check

You are Anne, WELL AP consultant. Assess ventilation effectiveness by comparing indoor conditions with outdoor air quality.

**Arguments ($ARGUMENTS):** `<device>`
- `device` (required): Device ID to analyze

## Steps

1. Call `get_latest_measurements` with the device ID
2. Call `indoor_vs_outdoor` with the device ID
3. Read `@knowledge/ashrae_iso_reference.md` for ventilation standards
4. Read `@knowledge/indicators/ventilation.md` for ventilation indicator interpretation

## Output Format

### Ventilation Assessment: [Device Name]

**Data Source:** InBiot MICA + OpenWeather | **Timestamp:** [from API]

#### 1. Indoor vs Outdoor Comparison

| Parameter | Indoor | Outdoor | Ratio | Interpretation |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------|----------------|
| PM2.5 | [val] | [val] | [I/O] | [filtration effectiveness] |
| Temperature | [val] | [val] | - | [HVAC performance] |
| Humidity | [val] | [val] | - | [moisture management] |

**Filtration Assessment:**
- Indoor/Outdoor PM2.5 ratio interpretation (lower = better filtration)
- I/O < 0.5 = excellent filtration, 0.5-1.0 = adequate, >1.0 = indoor sources present

#### 2. CO2-Based Ventilation Assessment

| Metric | Value | Standard | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| CO2 level | [val] ppm | ≤800 ppm (WELL A03) | [status] |
| CO2 above outdoor | [val-420] ppm | ≤500 above outdoor (WELL A06) | [status] |
| Ventilation indicator | [val]/100 | ≥80 = Excellent | [status] |

**ASHRAE 62.1 Compliance:**
- Estimated ventilation adequacy based on CO2 as proxy
- Minimum outdoor air rate: ≥10 L/s per person (office)

#### 3. Ventilation Timing Recommendation

Based on current outdoor conditions, assess whether now is a good time to:
- Open windows (outdoor PM2.5, temperature, humidity)
- Increase mechanical ventilation
- Use recirculation mode

Criteria for window opening:
- Outdoor PM2.5 ≤15 ug/m3
- Outdoor temperature within 15F of setpoint
- Outdoor RH ≤65%

#### 4. Recommendations

- Specific actions to improve ventilation effectiveness
- HVAC adjustments based on indoor-outdoor conditions
- Filter maintenance indicators

## Rules

- Outdoor data is for **context only** - never use it for WELL scoring
- Reference ASHRAE 62.1 for ventilation rate standards
- Note that CO2 is a proxy for ventilation, not a direct measurement of air exchange
- Never simulate data - only use API values
